# AJAX Lab

## Description
Scan the documentation for the Star Wars API. Create an app that implements the following user stories:

* As a user, I should see a list of starship cards when the site loads. The list should also indicate the number of results that are being displayed currently.
* As a user, I should see the name, starship class, starship manufacturer, and starship model rendered in each starship card.
* As a user, I should see a search bar above the list of starships. I should be able to enter in the name of a starship into the search bar, and submit my query.
* As a user, when I submit a search, the starship results being displayed should update based on my query

## Level Up
Create separate components for the following sections of the page:

* List of starships
* Starship search form
